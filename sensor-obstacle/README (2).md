![ky033](images/ky033.jpg)

Theoretically this is made for tracking lines, though, through tests, it detects any close object (obstacle detection).

Calibrate it through the potentiometer. It may make a great difference on results.

**Works best in the dark.**


The pin connection for the extension board, where (`sensor: board`) - following the [example code](tracking.py):
* S:	D27
* (middle pin):	V
* -:	G
